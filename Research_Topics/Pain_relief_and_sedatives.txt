====== Pain relief and sedatives ======

I made a pain relief and sedative tea for a friend who just had her IUD removed. :( 

The ingredients were:

[[../../Encyclopedia/Mullein.txt|Mullein]]
[[../../Encyclopedia/Skullcap.txt|Skullcap]]
[[../../Encyclopedia/Chamomile.txt|Chamomile]]
[[../../Encyclopedia/Echinacea.txt|Echinacea]]
[[../../Encyclopedia/California_poppy.txt|California poppy]]
[[../../Encyclopedia/Passionflower.txt|Passionflower]]

I wanted to do a little bit of research specifically on the painkilling and sedative properties of these plants. I also included a side sample of kratom, which I also wanted to include a little bit of info about here.
