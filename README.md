# Materia Medica

Autonomous mutual self-education about the wonderful world of medicinal plant technologies. :)

This repository contains a [Zim](http://zim-wiki.org/) notebook (functionally, a [wiki](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki)), for publishing ("open-sourcing") the knowledge of [Flora Posidonia](https://FloraPosidonia.xyz) herbalists. Knowledge is power, sharing is caring, and intellectual property is censorship.

We hope you will find this project useful as a compendium for your own self-education. Remember, "medicine is made from plants, yo."

## How to use this repository

The herbalists at Flora Posidonia use a number of technologies to make our work easier. To use this repository, and especially to contribute to it, you will need to familiarize yourself with the following [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) tools:

* Zim - Locally-hosted, simple, flat-file wiki software. This repository is "just" a Zim notebook.

If you don't already have Zim installed on your computer, you can download it from [Zim-Wiki.org](http://Zim-Wiki.org/). Once installed, you will need to acquire a copy of the Materia Medica files, themselves.

* Download the latest published ("stable") release of Materia Medica from Flora Posidonia. It's free. :)
* [Download the latest work-in-progress ("development") copy of Materia Medica from GitHub](https://github.com/aubrel/materia-medica/archive/master.zip). It's also free. :)

Regardless of which copy you download, you will then need to open (launch) Zim, add the folder you downloaded to Zim, and away you go.
